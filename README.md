# How it works
### Lazy way
You can choose a lazy way by selecting the type of layers like groups, shapes, symbols, text layers and bitmaps.

### Or not so lazy
If you call your layers semantically, the plugin will allow you to select them manually by name. 

Also possible to choose layers by the flag.***^***



# Usage
**select the types of layers**
